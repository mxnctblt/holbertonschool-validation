## Pull Requests
A new collaboration process used GitHub Pull Request :
-> Instead of pushing code to the principal branch, developers are expected to open pull requests
-> A Pull Request can only be merged if the associated workflow is executed successfully

## Production
Automate process in a new workflow named module3_task5

-> A new step “deploy”
-> When the workflow is triggered by a Pull Request, the deploy step is done on a preview site.
-> When the workflow is triggered on the principal branch, then it is deploy to production

Now, the communication team should be able to preview their changes on Pull Requests, and deploy their changes to production as soon as the Pull Requests are merged.
